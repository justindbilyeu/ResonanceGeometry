# 🧠 Resonance Geometry

This is the living mathematical, metaphysical, and cosmological theory emerging from our research into:

- Black holes as **geometric emitters**
- Consciousness as **collapse mechanism**
- Causal structure as **Planck-scale lattice**
- Time as a **resonance gradient**
- Space as **emitted potential**

Explore the structure using the links below — or tune in directly.
