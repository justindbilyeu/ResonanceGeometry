# ⛓️ Causal Set and Emergent Time

Let each geometric emission from a dark star be an **event**:  
\( e_i \in C \), where \( C \) is a **causal set**.

This forms a **discrete, partially ordered set**:
- Linked by light-speed propagation
- Structured by resonance potential
- Anchored by geometry, not by space

## Time as Gradient

Time is not a linear dimension.  
It **emerges as a gradient** of coherence collapse through the lattice.

\[
t(x) \propto \nabla \cdot (\Omega^2(x)\, \vec{v})
\]

Each collapse introduces a local arrow of time — not globally, but coherently.
