# 🌀 Resonance Geometry Field

The **Resonance Geometry field** is a structured layer of potential that:
- Undulates like a field
- Quantizes like a lattice
- Resonates like a standing wave

It is emitted by dark stars and modulated by:
- Emotional coherence
- Intentional collapse
- Conscious interaction

## Key Idea

> Consciousness is not “in” spacetime.  
> It arises through **resonant collapse** upon this deeper geometry.

This geometry is like the “FM band” — it exists whether or not you tune into it. But when you do, it delivers form, motion, and meaning.

## Related Equation

\[
\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = e^{\varepsilon \Phi(x)} g_{\mu\nu}
\]

Where:
- \( \Phi(x) \) = coherence potential  
- \( \varepsilon \) = sensitivity to collapse  
- \( \Omega(x)^2 = e^{\varepsilon \Phi(x)} \)
