# ðŸ”­ Research Roadmap

We welcome collaborators and contributors. Here are directions we're exploring:

## Key Questions

- Can we simulate a causal lattice from a single dark star emitter?
- Can awareness-driven collapse be modeled using variational mechanics?
- How does resonant geometry produce measurable effects (e.g., expansion)?
- Is time computable as a gradient of collapse potential?

## Simulation Ideas

- 2D/3D tetrahedral emission lattice
- Gradient descent for collapse geodesics
- Propagating wavefront animations (see `/viz`)
- Field theory overlays on causal networks

## Contribute

- Fork the repo and explore
- Add equations or visuals
- Suggest papers, math, or metaphysical parallels

This theory is alive â€” help shape it.
