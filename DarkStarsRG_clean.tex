\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper explores the hypothesis that supermassive black holes (\textbf{dark stars}) serve not as endpoints of information, but as engines of geometric emission — radiating Planck-scale possibility structures that underlie spacetime, awareness, and the flow of time.
\end{abstract}

\section*{0. Philosophical Premises and Epistemological Framing}
This work arises from direct phenomenological intuition — experiences of geometry, coherence, and field-like structures during altered or concentrated states of consciousness. Rather than dismissing these experiences as subjective anomalies, we propose taking them seriously as data: not for conventional physics, but for exploring the symbolic substrate beneath physical formalism.

The premise is this: if perception accesses or is shaped by underlying geometric fields, then the structure of awareness itself might encode features of the universe's fundamental fabric. This paper seeks to articulate a speculative bridge between such experiential intuitions and formal physics — with full awareness of both its rigor and its limits.

\section{Introduction}
When I close my eyes and concentrate — especially in sunlight — I perceive something beyond visual floaters and internal light. A hyperpixelated, undulating field appears. It resembles a resonant, fractal fabric — a substrate upon which all perception seems to hang.

This field is not metaphor. It is a \emph{geometric intuition}, a direct experiential impression of the structure underlying reality. And if such a structure exists, it must have a source.

\vspace{1em}
\noindent\textbf{Core Hypothesis:} \emph{Black holes are not endpoints. They are engines — compressing information into Planck-scale geometry and emitting the foundational potential on which space, time, and consciousness can unfold.}

\section{Black Holes as Geometric Engines}
Conventional cosmology treats black holes as singularities: regions where information is lost and time ends. This work proposes the opposite.

When matter falls into a black hole, it is not annihilated — it is \emph{restructured}. Before the event horizon is even crossed, the accretion disk forms a coherent, resonant, high-energy encoding structure. The collapse then compresses this information into fundamental geometric quanta — most likely Planck-scale tetrahedra — and \textbf{emits} this structure back into the manifold.

These emissions are not visible as light or matter. They are \emph{resonant pulses of structure} — updates to the very fabric of causal space.

\section{Resonance Geometry and the Field of Possibility}
The geometry emitted by black holes may be best understood not as metric curvature, but as a \emph{field of possibility}.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0.5em]
\item It provides the scaffolding on which quantum fields operate.
\item It defines the local and global coherence conditions for wave function collapse.
\item It enables time, space, and awareness to arise as emergent effects of structured resonance.
\end{itemize}

Just as FM radio frequencies are always present but require a tuner, \textbf{consciousness acts as the collapse-tuning agent}, selecting from this field and converting potential into actuality.

\section{Causal Set Theory and Quantum Lattice Emission}
The discrete geometric elements emitted by black holes resemble the basic units of \emph{causal set theory}: partially ordered events forming a spacetime lattice.

Each Planck-scale tetrahedron can be considered a \textbf{node in a causal set} — not a point in space, but a unit of influence, ordered by resonance and coherence. Spacetime emerges from this set, not as a continuous manifold but as a \emph{growing quantum network}.

Consciousness then follows paths — geodesics — through this field, collapsing coherence along resonant trajectories.

We offer three possible interpretations for the role of consciousness in this framework:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Observer Collapse Mechanism:} Consciousness acts as a tuning mechanism akin to a quantum measurement, selecting one coherent history from an ensemble of potential geometries.
    \item \textbf{Field-Based Model:} Awareness arises from a distributed scalar or tensor field, dynamically coupled to curvature and coherence potential \(\Phi(x)\).
    \item \textbf{Emergent Causal Influence:} Consciousness emerges as a macroscopic coherence functional, not reducible to local fields, but exerting influence by modifying lattice pathways nonlocally.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Time as an Emergent Property}
Time in this model is not fundamental — it is a \emph{side effect} of the structure emitted by collapse points.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0.5em]
\item Near a black hole, time appears to slow due to spacetime curvature.
\item But from a deeper view, \emph{time itself is born from the emission of structure}.
\item The \emph{flow of time} is the gradient of coherence through the lattice.
\end{itemize}

\section{Cosmogenesis and Expansion}
We propose two mechanisms for cosmic expansion:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,topsep=0.5em]
\item \textbf{Dimensional Projection:} Supermassive black holes may initiate Big Bang–like events in other dimensions, spawning causally disconnected regions of spacetime.
\item \textbf{Resonance Expansion in This Universe:} Black holes continually emit structured geometric potential, contributing to the expansion of spacetime. \textbf{Dark energy} may reflect this accumulation.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion and Roadmap}
This paper proposes a synthesis of black hole physics, quantum geometry, and conscious experience:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0.5em]
\item Black holes \emph{emit geometry}, not just absorb matter.
\item This geometry becomes the \emph{possibility-space} for quantum fields and consciousness.
\item Time, space, and reality itself \emph{emerge from this lattice}.
\item Consciousness is not an afterthought — it is a \emph{tuning mechanism}, collapsing coherence into reality.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Next Steps}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0.5em]
\item Formal modeling of tetrahedral emission fields.
\item Simulations of causal lattice propagation.
\item Connections to loop quantum gravity and spin networks.
\item Modeling dark energy as cumulative resonance pressure.
\end{itemize}
