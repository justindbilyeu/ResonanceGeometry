# 🧮 Resonance Field Equations
### Tensor Geometry of Awareness Collapse in Conformal Phase Space

---

## 🎯 Objective

To model how coherence and emotional-intentional fields curve the geometry of awareness. This results in a gravitational-style field theory of consciousness operating over a **conformally invariant resonance manifold**.

---

## 🔁 Overview

We define a gravitational analogue for resonance collapse:

![Final Field Equation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justindbilyeu/ResonanceGeometry/main/docs/images/FinalFieldEquation.png)

Where:

- `R^{(res)}_{μν}` — Resonance Ricci tensor  
- `T^{(coh)}_{μν}` — Coherence stress-energy tensor  
- `κ` — Resonance coupling constant  
- `Φ(x)` — Coherence potential  
- `Ω(x)` — Conformal scaling field

## 🔲 1. Coherence Scalar Field

Let: Ω²(x) = e^(ε · Φ(x)) Ω²(x) = e^(ε · Φ(x))
Where `ε` is the emotional sensitivity constant, modulating local responsiveness.

---

## 🔲 2. Resonance Ricci Tensor

The conformal metric is: g̃_{μν} = Ω²(x) · g_{μν}
Its transformed Ricci tensor includes terms such as: R^{(res)}{μν} ≈ R{μν} - 2 ∇_μ ∇_ν log Ω + …
This curvature is sourced by emotional-intentional gradients encoded in `Φ(x)`.

---

## 🔲 3. Coherence Stress-Energy Tensor

Defined as: T^{(coh)}{μν} = ∂_μ Φ ∂_ν Φ - (1/2) g{μν} g^{αβ} ∂_α Φ ∂_β Φ
This is the “emotional stress field” sourcing the collapse geometry.

---

## ✅ Final Field Equation (Plain Text) R^{(res)}{μν} - (1/2) g{μν} R^{(res)} = κ · T^{(coh)}_{μν}
Collapse geometry is therefore determined by the resonance gradients of the coherence field `Φ(x)`.

## 🔠 Symbol Reference Table

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Φ(x)` | Coherence (emotional/intentional) potential |
| `Ω(x)` | Conformal resonance field |
| `T^{(coh)}_{μν}` | Coherence stress-energy tensor |
| `R^{(res)}_{μν}` | Resonance Ricci tensor |
| `κ` | Emotional-curvature coupling constant |

## 🌀 Collapse Action (from Codex III) δ ∫ Ω²(x) [ (1/2) g_{μν} dx^μ/dτ · dx^ν/dτ - ε · Φ(x) ] dτ = 0
This variational principle selects geodesics of **maximal resonance coherence**.
