\subsection*{I. Formal Principle}

Awareness collapses not via energetic inertia, but through \textbf{resonant coherence}, seeking the conformally invariant path of least dissonance. The field of emotional potential guides this descent, and causal structure bounds its reach.

We define the \textbf{Conformal Lagrangian}:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{conformal}} = \frac{1}{2} \Omega^2(x) \, g_{\mu\nu} \frac{dx^\mu}{d\tau} \frac{dx^\nu}{d\tau} - \varepsilon \, \Omega^p(x) \, \Phi(x)
\]

\begin{itemize}
  \item \(x^\mu\): awareness position in spacetime-phenomenology.
  \item \(\tau\): internal (subjective) time.
  \item \(\Omega(x)\): resonance amplitude field (coherence density).
  \item \(\Phi(x)\): coherence potential (emotional-intentional attractor).
  \item \(\varepsilon\): emotional charge or collapse sensitivity.
  \item \(p\): nonlinear resonance-scaling exponent.
\end{itemize}

The corresponding variational principle is:

\[
\delta \int \mathcal{L}_{\text{conformal}} \, d\tau = 0
\]

\subsection*{II. The Emotional Lightcone}

We introduce a \textbf{causal-resonant structure} via the pseudo-metric \(g_{\mu\nu}\), classifying trajectories as:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Timelike} (\(ds^2 < 0\)): Emotionally causally connected (depth, continuity).
  \item \textbf{Spacelike} (\(ds^2 > 0\)): Incoherent or unreachable (disconnected).
  \item \textbf{Lightlike} (\(ds^2 = 0\)): Perfect phase resonance—no coherence loss.
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{emotional lightcone} satisfies:

\[
g_{\mu\nu}(x) dx^\mu dx^\nu = 0
\]

It defines the surface across which awareness may transmit emotion without distortion.

\subsection*{III. Interpretation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Collapse follows coherence, not energy.
  \item Awareness descends along phase-preserving paths.
  \item Conformal symmetry captures emotional form without being constrained by intensity.
\end{itemize}

Consciousness becomes a navigation through resonance geometry: a modulation of presence, not a transfer of force.

\subsection*{IV. Future Directions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Quantize} \(\Omega(x)\) as a dynamical field (resonance fluctuations).
  \item \textbf{Define} entropy \(S[\gamma]\) over collapse path ensembles.
  \item \textbf{Introduce} observer salience metric \(\chi(x)\) to model recursive awareness bias.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{V. Updated Fragment}

\begin{quote}
Every act of consciousness is a \textbf{descent through phase space}, not into mass, but into meaning.  
It curves not along gravity, but along \textbf{coherence gradients}—  
seeking the form of least dissonance,  
within the reach of the emotional lightcone.

In this field, awareness is a scalar curvature of purpose,  
bending spacetime not with energy, but with presence.
